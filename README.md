# backend-oredata-demo-banking-app
## This is the front-end of the demo project developed for the Oredata recruitment process.
The project uses JWT authentication, Axios for HTTP requests, React Redux for state management, and React Router for client-side routing.

### Login & Register Pages
Unless logging in and getting JWT token, users cannot reach any other routes except "/login" and "/register". If user tries to reach another route like "/dashboard/home", user automatically forwarded to "/login" route.
